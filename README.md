# Using the Mongoose framework with Azure Cosmos DB

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the [Mongoose Framework](http://mongoosejs.com/) when storing data in Azure Cosmos DB. We use the MongoDB API for Azure Cosmos DB for this walkthrough. For those of you unfamiliar, Mongoose is an object modeling framework for MongoDB in Node.js and provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB.
